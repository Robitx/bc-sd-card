# Instalation 
## Dependencies
python3
Python modules: sklearn numpy scipy

## Notes
You can probably install python modules using:
`sudo pip3 install sklearn numpy scipy`

# Usage
## Makefile
Run `make` to display this readme.

Run `make train` to train models using 4 interesting feature configurations.
All results are stored in results directory.

Run `make clean` to delete trained models.
Also deletes all other files generated by training script.

# Notes
## Implementation
Sources in the src/code/more directory are attached to show some of the tools created during this work.
Most of them cannot be executed because of one or more of following reasons:
They have closed source dependencies.
They were used to process non public data.
They require large quantities of data.

## Organization data
Organizations data was attached to show the stages of formating and processing of the data.
